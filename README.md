# 🧠 Case Study Repository: The Cold Genius and the Fractured Trust

This repository contains a teaching case model of **ruptured trust recovery** in high-stakes clinical care. It explores the dynamic between an emotionally fragile patient and a world-class but emotionally distant physician ("Dr. Holt"), following a diagnostic error, relational rupture, and eventual repair attempt.

## 🧑‍🏫 Teaching Applications

This case can be used in:
- Clinical supervision workshops (e.g., boundary setting, repair after rupture)
- AI/LLM evaluation environments simulating emotionally complex care
- Medical humanities and narrative medicine courses
- Ethics and communication training for high-stakes medicine

## ❓ Suggested Discussion Prompts

1. **Clinical Ethics**: Was Dr. Holt justified in terminating care after the patient’s emotional outburst?  
2. **Trust and Repair**: What does this case suggest about reengagement after boundary rupture?  
3. **Asymmetrical Empathy**: Can a therapeutic relationship survive without affective warmth if it has structural integrity?  
4. **AI Simulation Value**: How can language models support training in emotionally difficult care scenarios?  
5. **Real-World Parallel**: Have you encountered a version of this tension in your own clinical or professional life?
